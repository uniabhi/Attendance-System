Facial Recognition Based Attendance System using Python, Tensorflow, Keras, SqlLite3, Tkinter, OpenCV for companies, schools, colleges, etc.

Automating attendance using Face Recognition via Neural Networks

The entire process of marking attendance in educational institutions, workplaces, when automized is the best and most cost effective way of making it fool-proof and better.

This makes proxy attendance impossible and the workplace ethics- trustworthy

This, while isn't the perfect way, it's an attempt to do something similar

This is an implementation by me using various methods - Via Multi Threaded Cascaded Neural Networks

Techologies Used:

Python
Tensorflow
Keras
SqlLite3
Tkinter
OpenCV
Using MTCNN we mapped out the 128 feature map from each side of the face to create a 3D grid like structure.
